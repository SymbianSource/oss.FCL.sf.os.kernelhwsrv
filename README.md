# miraiOS
miraiOS is a mobile operating system based on the open source verion of SymbianOS. SymbianOS was superior in OS development and we will follow its steps. By this project we are aiming porting SymbianOS in modern devices, design and build a beautiful interface and make an easy to use SDK for it.The first versions will target comercial use, since this is the most efficient way. But we will try our best and we wont use any proprietary software.
