# miraiOS
MiraiOS is a mobile operating system based on the open source verion of SymbianOS. SymbianOS was superior in OS development and we will follow its steps. By this project we are aiming porting SymbianOS in modern devices, design and build a beautiful interface and make an easy to use SDK for it. The first versions will target comercial use, since this is the most efficient way to succed. We will try our best and we wont use any proprietary software. More information about the devices we are going to support, the interface and the SDK will be uploaded soon.
# Security
SymbianOS was itself a secure platform so we dont really have to change a lot of things. But since SymbianOS is a RTOS microkernel system we have to improve the security. We are considering using tweaked openBSD patents so miraiOS would be more secure. 
# App development
On a proper operating system app development should be easy and free. Our SDK will be free and made for multiple platforms and maybe even for the web. The main languages for app development will be QT, Python, Java ME, Flash Lite, Ruby, .NET, Web Runtime and C/C++. We will also make the SDK look familiar for easibility reasons.
# Branding and Naming
The name "mirai" means "future" in Japanese(未来). Because mirai represents the "future" of SymbianOS. Our branding is simple, three dots in different size and color. These three dots represent divercity and simpletivity, which are mirai's principles.![mirailogo1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82805203/115434155-0b243c80-a211-11eb-85b2-a0080896ab1e.png)
